# CQL8RQRTAG

## Inspiration

Not wanting to lose our childhood favorite games to the mobile era, we decided to re-imagine them in a way that incorporates modern technology and brings to the forefront how technology can improve our social lives.
##What it does

Our technology provides a platform for users to engage in social games while providing real time and honest score keeping.
## How we built it

Our technology stack includes the following: HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Jquery, Socket.io, Nginx, Gunicorn, Flask, Python, MongoDB, Google Cloud Platform.

We started with the example code for a chat room that comes with Flasks Socket.io and learned how sockets work. We built our own functions, classes, and data structures to make a dynamic platform. Our code runs on the google cloud platform with the domain name qrtag.org.

Our application boasts a custom original score by our team member Conner Shehan.
## Challenges we ran into

We faced and overcame many issues in our application development cycle. We found that building a responsive website that incorporates many elements while supporting mobile and desktop platforms to be a bigger issue that we anticipated.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of

A platform that works and that can bring people together. We worked as a team through countless servings of caffeine and built an application we are really proud of!
What we learned

Teamwork, Communication, and that SoyLent is Acceptable. We also learned a lot about the software development cycle and became more familiar with whats possible in unfamiliar languages.
## What's next for QR Tag

More Game Modes such as Capture the flag, Tag, Last one standing, Lazer Quest.

Features such as GeoFencing. Which would be the ability to set a location and boundaries for games. Also the ability to decrease play area as time goes on. Also Merchandise items such QR shirts and QR stickers.
